# dnsmasq-jq

## WAT?

A DNSMasq container configured via environment variable

## HOW?

Specify a set of domains to map to ips and ports like so:
`DOMAIN_JSON='{"local":["127.0.0.1#50053"], "*": ["8.8.8.8"]}'`

The above config would send anything with a `.local` domain to 127.0.0.1 on
port 50053, while any other requests would go to 8.8.8.8

Specify all you like. Keep it simple
